                    <p>
                        <strong>I love working on open-source projects!</strong> I've held many
                        different roles in the open-source ecosystem. I started my own
                        projects, sent in patches to other people's projects, packaged
                        software for Linux distributions and Windows, created useful
                        bug reports.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Software development is exciting for me. I like solving interesting problems
                        and doing cool projects. I also enjoy tinkering around with
                        new features in experimental git branches and discussing the course of
                        projects on mailing lists. I love the social and collaborative open-source
                        experience on platforms such as <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm a hobbyist game developer who regularly participates in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam">game jams</a>.
                        I loved doing game jams so much that I even started up my own <a href="http://bacongamejam.org">game jam platform</a>! Game development allows for lots of creativity and holds many
                        very interesting problems on every level of the stack.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm a Developer and Trusted User on <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>,
                        a Linux distribution for advanced users. I maintain
                        <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=svenstaro">lots of packages</a>
                        on that project. Often times, packages break and need patches
                        in order to build.
                        Due to Arch's philosophy, I usually speak to the affected software's projects
                        directly and send in helpful patches and bug descriptions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For my Bachelor's thesis, I wrote a path tracer called <a href="https://github.com/svenstaro/trac0r">trac0r</a>
                        in an attempt to evaluate the performance and feasibility of real-time path tracing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm a knowledgeable system administrator for Linux systems. I've been diligently
                        running web servers, mail systems and various minor services for years.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can sometimes find me on various Linux/software conventions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I sometimes create 3D art and models in <a href="http://blender.org">Blender</a> and 2D sprites with <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Natural languages: English, German</li>
                        <li>Programming languages I like using for serious work: C, C++, Rust, Python, Shell, JavaScript, SQL (yes, not technically programming)</li>
                        <li>Programming languages for hobby work: Lua, D, Dart, CoffeeScript, Racket</li>
                        <li>Programming languages I don't really like using: PHP, Java</li>
                        <li>Markup languages (X)HTML, HTML5, CSS2/3</li>

                    <p>
                        You can expect me to pick up any additional languages in a reasonable amount of time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Along with those languages, I use a bunch of tools to accomplish different
                        tasks. My favorite tools in no particular order: git, vim, valgrind, gdb, ansible, cmake, ssh, qtcreator
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm also familiar with some of the popular libraries and frameworks in every language's
                        ecosystem such as Boost, Qt, Django, Flask, Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS, React/Redux.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have experience with <strong>high-performance computing</strong> using distributed memory (using MPI)
                        and shared memory (using pthreads) as well as intermediate-level server operation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Due to my activity in past projects, I have a firm understanding of how a Linux userland fits
                        together at every level. I've assembled my own Linux distribution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, I'm well-versed in <strong>automating and orchestrating servers</strong>. I can create
                        deployment workflows for all kinds of applications, be it web, mobile or desktop. I know how and when
                        to use cloud-based deployment platforms such as <strong>AWS</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm good at team communication, knowledge management and keep a consistent, dogmatic coding style.
                        I value good documentation and tests. I'm no stranger to reading other peoples' code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I can design APIs (both <strong>REST</strong>ful and not) as
                        well as UIs and reason about UX. I code with security in mind.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Keeping in mind modern processors, I can reason about cache performance, data/cache coherency and
                        program with that in mind while not over-thinking performance where it doesn't matter.
